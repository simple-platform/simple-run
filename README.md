# Simple Run

## Overview

Welcome! _Simple Run_ simplifies how you run software projects on your local machine. It's centered around a _"Run Locally"_ button that project maintainers can add to their README.md files. This button is your gateway to hassle-free project setup. _Simple Run_ clones the repository to your machine when clicked and sets everything up using a docker-compose.yaml or Dockerfile. Our goal is to create a powerful and easy-to-use tool that can run any project on your local machine using containers — simplifying the process of getting started.

## Motivation

Our motivation comes from a universal pain point: the often complex and tedious process of setting up a local environment for a new project. We've experienced the frustration of following multiple steps only to encounter errors that slow down progress. This can be daunting, especially for those new to coding or contributing to open-source projects. We've developed this tool — to eliminate those barriers and make the initial setup as smooth as possible. Inspired by the simplicity of "Deploy to Heroku" but focused on local development, we're here to ensure that everyone, regardless of their experience level, can easily engage with and contribute to the software they care about.
